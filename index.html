      <h1 class="about-heading">A Little Bit About Me!</h1>
      <p class="about-p">I am a current student at The Univesity of Florida working towards a B.S. 
        in Computer Science through the UF Honors Program. My current interest include
       operating systems, cybersecurity, and web development, but I am excited to learn 
       more about the world of CS as I take more courses and work on more projects. When 
       not studying for my exams, I enjoy playing the piano, studying Spanish, and traveling
       whenver I can.</p>

                <p class = "project-title">Personal Website!</p>
                <p>You've made it! This website is made using HTML, CSS, and JS only. I decided to create it not
                  only to showcase my skills and projects, but also as a starter project to get the very basics of
                  web development under my belt. I worked on this project throughout the summer after my freshman year
                  of college while balancing a job and a heavy courseload.

              <p class = "project-title">Movie Matchmaker Project</p>
              <p>This project was created by two of my colleagues in my Data Structures and Algorithm's class and I.
                We built a simple algorithm to rank movies based on user preferences. We utilized both a heap and graph 
                data structure and compared the times of the two algorithms, eventually determining that a heap worked 
                way faster in this context.

              <p class = "project-title">More Coming Soon!</p>
              <p>As it is still early in my journey into tech, this is all I have for now, but I am hoping to increase
                the number of projects I have on my resume as I grow and learn more as I advance through my degree.
