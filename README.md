# Personal Website

Check out this website for a condensed, easy-to-read summary of my experience, education, projects, and more information about me! This is still a work in progress as this is a project in of itself but soon this will be a full-fledged website!

# Implementation

Since this is my first Web project, I am just using pure HTML, CSS, and JS to get a feel for how to use these technologies to create a fully-fledged, functional, good-looking website. After getting a handle on these technologies, I plan to learn other frameworks for web such as Node.js and Flask/Django.
